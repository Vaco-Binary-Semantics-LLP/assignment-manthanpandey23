This React app have a very basic functionalities.
### View Each Player from nested List using nested map function
### View Each Team with their players using nested map function
### For searching I used fuse js library on players page

I have used state Hook, props, filter, map and arrow function in react components.

Remaining:
### Add and Remove Teams or Players
